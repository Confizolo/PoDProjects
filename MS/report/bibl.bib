It allows us to collect a full data set with one crystal in 2.5 h by rotation of a sample around a single axis. The high accuracy and extended resolution of the collected data were confirmed by comparison with the data obtained from other detectors and results from the structure determination. Further improvements in the function and accuracy of this system are discussed.}

  abstract = {Abstract Simulaid performs a large number of simulation-related tasks: interconversion and modification of structure and trajectory files, optimization of orientation, and a large variety of analysis functions. The program can handle structures in PDB (Berman et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2000, 28, 235), Charmm (Brooks et al., J Comput Chem 4, 187) CRD, Amber (Case et al.), Macromodel (Mohamadi et al., J Comput Chem 1990, 11, 440), Gromos/Gromacs (Hess et al.), InsightII (InsightII.

Available at: http://inka.mssm.edu/∼mezei/mmc) formats; and trajectories in the formats of Charmm, Amber, Macromodel, and MMC. Analysis features include (but are not limited to): (1) simple distance calculations and hydrogen-bond analysis, (2) calculation of 2-D RMSD maps (produced both as text file with the data and as a color-coded matrix) and cross RMSD maps between trajectories, (3) clustering based on RMSD maps, (4) analysis of torsion angles, Ramachandran (Ramachandran and Sasiskharan, Adv Protein Chem 1968, 23, 283) angles, proline kink (Visiers et al., Protein Eng 2000, 13, 603) angles, pseudorotational (Altona and Sundaralingam, J Am Chem Soc 1972, 94, 8205; Cremer and Pople, J Am Chem Soc 1975, 97, 1354) angles, and (5) analysis based on circular variance (Mezei, J Mol Graphics Model 2003, 21, 463). Torsion angle evolutions are presented in dial plots (Ravishanker et al., J Biomol Struct Dyn 1989, 6, 669). Several of these features are unique to Simulaid. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
